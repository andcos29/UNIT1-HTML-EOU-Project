<p>I have played guitar for four years and have preformed live in front of crowds many times. I specialize in rock, metal, and blues and have preformed in many metal and rock bands. I have always loved music and have a wide music taste. I love funk, disco, metal, rock, blues, and hip-hop. I also play piano and specialize in blues and I also collect records. I have many records by Micheal Jackson and Prince.</p>
