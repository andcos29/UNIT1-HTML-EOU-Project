<h3> My Background </h3>
<p>I'm a freshman in Bergen Tech Teterboro, enrolled in the Computer Science major. I joined this program because I love technology and have always had an intrest in coding and creating websites and games. I am intrested in problem solving through technology and this is the best way to achieve my goals. I have always wanted to help others and want to create things people actually use.</p>
   <p>Outside of school, I have always been intrested in video games, technology, and coding itself. On my own I have coded with many different softwares and languages, like python, CoBlocks, Unity, and Scratch. </p>
